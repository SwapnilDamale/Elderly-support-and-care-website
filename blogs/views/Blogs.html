                    <h2>Senior Cardio Exercises: Boosting Fitness for Seniors Over 70</h2>
                    <b>Importance of Cardiovascular Exercise for Seniors</b><p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
                    As we age, maintaining a strong cardiovascular system becomes increasingly important. Engaging in
                    aerobics for seniors can help improve their heart health, boost endurance, and enhance their overall
                    quality of life.

                    Regular cardio exercises for seniors can also contribute to weight management, reduce the risk of
                    chronic diseases, and improve mood and mental well-being.

                    A robust cardiovascular system is essential because it supplies oxygen and nutrients to the bodys
                    tissues, removes waste products, and helps regulate body temperature. Additionally, it reduces the
                    risk of conditions such as heart disease, stroke, and high blood pressure—common concerns for
                    seniors.</p>

                    <b>Assess Mobility Level</b><p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
                    The first step is evaluating the seniors current mobility and anticipated needs. This determines
                    whether a manual or power wheelchair is most appropriate.<br><br>
                    
                        <b>Manual wheelchairs</b> are ideal for seniors who have assistance pushing or still have upper
                        body strength. They have large rear wheels that the user propels themselves. Many are
                        lightweight and foldable for transporting.<br><br>
                        <b>Power wheelchairs</b> are best for those with limited arm and grip strength. The
                        battery-powered motor assists movement using a joystick or other controls. Power chairs are
                        heavier and may not fold.
