    <img src="/health/images/Blogs/image17.jpg" height="500" width="80%">
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 40px;">As we grow older, the desire to travel and explore new places doesn’t diminish – in fact, it often grows stronger. With retirement freeing up time and resources, many elderly couples find themselves eager to go on adventures they couldn’t enjoy during their working years. A study by AARP found that 47% of Baby Boomers plan to travel more for leisure after retirement. However, travel for seniors comes with its own set of considerations and challenges. The perfect holiday requires careful thought and research.

We’ll go into the factors that make a destination senior-friendly, highlight popular attractions, and provide practical tips for an enjoyable and stress-free travel experience. </p><br><br>
