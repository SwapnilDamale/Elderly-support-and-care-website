    <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 40px;">It is no secret that seniors aged 65 and above need extra care for
        their health. Impaired quality of life and sickness should not accompany ageing. Starting young is usually a
        good idea because it has been observed that young people with healthy habits mature nicely. But it is equally
        crucial to realise that you can always start living a healthy lifestyle. Physical and mental health both
        diminish as people age. A person’s skin, bones, brain, teeth, eyes, and much more will change as they age.
        Therefore, it is even more crucial for seniors to take special care of themselves.

        There are several hobbies for senior citizens to stay healthy and active. Regardless of their age, seniors will
        have the chance to achieve precisely that with the help of the unique activities for seniors listed below:
